HTML5 placeholder Polyfill
===========================

Lightweight and very robust little jQuery Plugin that generates the look and feel of the HTML5 placeholder attribut for Browsers without native support.

requires:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (tested with 1.4.2 but might as well work with older versions)
* [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) (tested with 2.0.6)

optional but recommended:

* [fontresize](http://www.tomdeater.com/jquery/onfontresize/) (excellent even though terribly unmaintained event plugin that fires when a user changes the fontsize of their Browser (that usually breaks the other placeholder polyfills))
